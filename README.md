# Recipes for Ingredients

**Recipes for Ingredients** is a school project that utilizes the open-source API TheMealDB to offer users recipes based on ingredients they submit.

## About

This project aims to simplify the process of finding recipes by allowing users to input a single ingredient and receive a variety of meal options. Whether you're looking to cook with leftovers, explore new flavors, or simply make the most of what's in your pantry, **Recipes for Ingredients** has you covered.

## Features

- **Ingredient-Based Search**: Users can enter a single ingredient, and **Recipes for Ingredients** will generate a list of recipes that incorporate that ingredient.
  
- **Recipe Details**: Each recipe includes detailed instructions and ingredients list from TheMealDB website.
